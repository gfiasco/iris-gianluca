### Getting There
- **Airports:**
  - *Catania (CTA)* â€” about a 1-hour drive
  - *Palermo (PMO)* â€” about a 3-hour drive

- **Car Hire:**
  Rental desks are available at both airports, but youâ€™ll often find better deals by booking online in advance (try booking.com or expedia.com).

> ðŸ’³ Tip: When renting a car, bring more than one credit card as backup in case of issues.

### For International & Long-Haul Travellers
- **Direct flights** to Catania or Palermo may not always be available from the US or Australia, so plan ahead.
- **If you arrive via Palermo**, consider turning the journey into part of your adventure. The drive across Sicily is dotted with historic towns, stunning coastlines, and plenty of opportunities to stop and explore.
- **If you have a layover in Rome**, embrace itâ€”Rome is truly breathtaking, and even a short stop can feel unforgettable.
