### Getting There
- **Airports:**
  - *Catania (CTA)* — about a 1-hour drive
  - *Palermo (PMO)* — about a 3-hour drive

- **Car Hire:**
  Rental desks are available at both airports, but you’ll often find better deals by booking online in advance (try booking.com or expedia.com).

> 💳 Tip: When renting a car, bring more than one credit card as backup in case of issues.

### Where to Stay

We personally visited the following places and can happily recommend them. Each offers a different charm, from rustic agriturismi to elegant hotels.
💡 **Tip:** It’s best to book directly with the property — and remember, *cash is king* in this region!

* **[Tenuta Arangio](https://www.vendicari-agriturismo.com/it)** — A welcoming agriturismo that may offer a special rate if you mention our names.
  📍 S.P. Pachino km 14,5, 96017 San Lorenzo SR, Italy

* **[Casa di Vendicari](https://www.casavendicari.it/en)** — A cozy countryside retreat nestled near the Vendicari Nature Reserve.
  📍 Contrada Vendicari, snc 96017, Noto – Sicilia

* **[La Corte del Sole](https://lacortedelsole.it/en/)** — A refined 4-star hotel overlooking the sea, combining comfort with Sicilian charm.

### For International & Long-Haul Travellers
- **Direct flights** to Catania or Palermo may not always be available from the US or Australia, so plan ahead.
- **If you arrive via Palermo**, consider turning the journey into part of your adventure. The drive across Sicily is dotted with historic towns, stunning coastlines, and plenty of opportunities to stop and explore.
- **If you have a layover in Rome**, embrace it—Rome is truly breathtaking, and even a short stop can feel unforgettable.
