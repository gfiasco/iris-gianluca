A wedding in Sicily **without food**? Impossible. We couldn’t leave you guessing — this section exists purely to make you hungry and eager to book your flights. 🍷🍋

### The Menu (highlights)

- **Arancini** – golden, crispy, and filled with love (and rice).
- **Paccheri ai frutti di mare** – pasta so wide it doubles as a shovel for clams, mussels & prawns.
- **Risotto agli scampi** – creamy, delicate, with that perfect Sicilian seafood sweetness.

And of course, **wine flows like water**, and there will be desserts so good you’ll forget about that diet (sorry, not sorry).

### Dietary Requirements
If you have allergies, intolerances, or just a very strong dislike of shellfish 🦐 — let us know when you RSVP. We’ll make sure you are well taken care of.

> Bring your appetite. Sicily will do the rest. 🇮🇹✨
